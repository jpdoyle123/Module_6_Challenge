# Module_6_Challenge

In this challenge, we were tasked with producing various interactive visualizations using the pyviz, hvplot and geoviews libraries on a dataset of housing indicators by neighborhood in San Francisco. The first section of this product involves the calculation of the housing units per year, and the plotting of them in an interactive bar chart. The chart is shown below

The next section, we calculate and plot average sales price per square foot, which exhibited a huge growth rate in gross rent compared to the smaller positive growth for average sales price per square foot.

Then, we computed the average sales price and gross rent by neighborhood, producing a plot with an interactive neighborhood chooser using groupby in the hvplot function.

Finally, we produced an interactive map of San Francisco, with average sales price and gross rent included.
